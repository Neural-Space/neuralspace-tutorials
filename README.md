 - Social media sites, being user-friendly and a free source, provide opportunities for people to air their voices. People, irrespective of age group, use these sites to share every moment of their lives, making these sites flooded with data. Due to the lack of restrictions set by these sites for their users to express their views as they like, anyone can make adverse and unrealistic comments in abusive language against anybody with an ulterior motive to tarnish oneâ€™s image and status in society.

 - Furthermore, the contents on such social media are spread in so many different languages. It becomes a huge responsibility for these sites to identify such hate content before it disseminates to the masses.

 - Let us use **NeuralSpace's NeuraLingo** to build an **end-to-end Twitter bot** which classfies hate and offensive tweets in **English, Hindi and Marathi languages**. 


 ## ðŸ‘‰ **Citizen Services**:

 - Citizen services refer to the essential services provided by organizations to general citizens. In this case, we focus on important services like **FIR, Blood/Platelets Donation, and Coronavirus-related queries etc**. 

 - Despite the importance of citizen services, linguistically rich countries like India are still far behind in delivering such essential needs to the citizens with absolute ease. The best services currently available do not exist in various low-resource languages that are native to different groups of people. This challenge aims to make government services more efficient, responsive, and customer-friendly.

- As our computing resources and modeling capabilities grow, so does our potential to support our citizens by delivering a far superior customer experience. Equipping a Citizen services bot with the ability to converse in Vernacular languages would make them accessible to a vast group of people for whom English is not a language of choice, but for who are increasingly turning to digital platforms and interfaces for a wide range of needs and wants. 

- Let us use **NeuralSpace's NeuraLingo** to build a Citizen Services NLU in **8 languages** namely, **English, Hindi, Bengali, Punjabi, Tamil, Telugu, Gujarati and Marathi**.


 ## ðŸ‘‰ **E-commerce Services**:

 [![Open In GitHub](images/github_badge.svg)](https://github.com/Neural-Space/neuralspace-transliteration-tutorial)

 - Through this transliteration bot, you can set your own **custom trigger phase** such that whenever anyone on twitter replies to a tweet mentioning this phrase, the bot transliterates the tweet in reply. 
 
 - Can be extended to other languages with very minimal changes.
